Client-side vs Server-side
--------------------------
- Server-side code is executed on the server
    - It's code is NOT accessible from the browser (client-side)
    - Only the output generated from the server-side code is accessible


- Client-side code is executed within the browser
    - Written by languages such as JavaScript
    - It's code is visible to a user
        - When viewing a web page's source code


- Why use a server-side programming language
    - Security          = It's code can NOT be seen
    - More efficient    = The browser (client-side) does NOT have to do any work
    - Database access   = Provide access to a Database
    - Filesystem access = Ability to read from and write to files
    - Authentication    = Create login / register functionality
    - Session           = Create session & session variables
